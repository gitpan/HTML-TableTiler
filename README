HTML::TableTiler README File
============================


Description
-----------

HTML::TableTiler uses a minimum HTML table as a tile to generate a complete
HTML table from a bidimensional array of data. It can easily produce simple or
complex graphic styled tables with minimum effort and maximum speed.

Think about the table tile as a sort of tile that automatically expands itself
to contain the whole data. You can control the final look of a table by choosing
either the HORIZONTAL and the VERTICAL tiling mode among: PULL, TILE and TRIM.

The main advantages to use it are:

* automatic table generation
  Pass only a bidimensional array of data to generate a complete HTML table.
  No worry to decide in advance the quantity of cells (or rows) in the table.

* complex graphic patterns generation without coding
  Just prepare a simple table tile in your preferred WYSIWYG HTML editor
  and let the module do the job for you.

* simple to maintain
  You can indipendently change the table tile or the code, and everything
  will go as you would expect.
